# NaiveAntColony
Implementation of a naive Ant Colony Clustering algorithm using [Mason](http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/).

## About
This is a simple implementation of a naive ant colony clustering algorithm.
"Naive" because this version of the algoritms does not use any form of pheromone trails.

This project was developed as an exercise for the Neural Network and Knowledge Discovery course during my Master's degree
in computer science.
