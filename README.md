# NaiveAntColony
Implementation of a naive Ant Colony Clustering algorithm using [Mason](http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/).

## About
This is a simple implementation of a naive ant colony clustering algorithm.
"Naive" because in this version of the algoritm ants do not have memory of the objects they picked in the previous iterations, nor they leave pheromone trails.

This project was developed as an exercise for the Neural Network and Knowledge Discovery course during my Master's degree in computer science.
